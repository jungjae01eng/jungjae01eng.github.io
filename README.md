 ## Hello!
  My name is Jungjae, and I am a rising junior majoring in Computer Engineering at Boston University.  
  
  Currently, I am on a gap year, engaged in research at Seoul National University, where my primary focus lies in conducting simulations for soft robotics.  
  (Will enlist in the Korean mandatory military service in January 2024)  
  
  This is my engineering portfolio, where you can find more information about me!

 ## About this page
  This page was initially crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on September 23rd, 2023, and I intend to continuously update this website as frequently as possible.  
  
  Ultimately, I aspire to use this website more extensively, as it provides a more effortless means of showcasing photos and documenting the progress of my engineering work.  
  
  You can also connect with me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/jungjae-engineering!~

 ## Organization of GitHub
  ### Branch:
   - **v(year).(month)**  
     - For instance, v23.09 will denote the branch corresponding to September 2023.

     - [ ]  **v23.xx** - year of 2023

  ### Tag:
   - **v(year).(06 OR 12).(major&minor&patch)**  
     - Tags will be organized into "06" or "12" categories.
        - If significant changes are implemented before the end of June in a specific year, the middle tag will be "06."
        - Conversely, if these changes occur after June, the middle tag will be "12."
        - This is intended to make it easy to revisit and track the progress as experiences and projects are updated each semester.
    - For instance, if we finalize the code and plan to deploy it in May 2023, it will be tagged as v23.06.00.

     - [ ]  **v23.12.xx** - July - December 2023
     - [ ]  **v24.06.xx** - January - June 2024
